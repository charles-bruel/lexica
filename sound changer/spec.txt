Each character will be stored as a 64-bit long
The 64-bit long will store feature information
The exact format is determined by the program
The beginning of the character is a type code, which differeniates different types of character (consonant, vowel, toneme, etc)
Derived features depend solely on other features
Sound changes are applied in order, using lexurgy format

The IPA and romanization system will derive from the definition
