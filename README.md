# Lexica

A W.I.P. conlanging tool with a rust backend for sound changes, saving, and maybe word generation, with a plain HTML/CSS/JS frontend. The goal is to create an IDE for conlangs that allows automatic propogation of sound changes or changes to the sound changes. 

The frontend aims to be better than Excel or other spreadsheet programs for conlanging by adding a specialized section for the lexicon, with the ability to take the entire lexicon of the proto-lang and import it, with sound changes to the modern lang. 

The sound changer backend aims to be as fast as possible for processing large quantities of words. The syntax is based on Lexurgy SC but I hope to improve on it with new options, particularly combination tables, and speed.

Saving will be done through the back end to avoid some of the issues with saving on the web (everything goes into downloads).

Potential features include integrated glossing, integrated declension/conjugation support, an irregular spelling helper, etc.
