# JS Frontend

This frontend is written in plain HTML, CSS, and JS, which was probably a mistake. I loathe JS and certainly should have used TS, and probably a framework too, but I don't know any. This code is a fine spaghetti mess and is unmaintainable and slow, but it (mostly) works and I can't be bothered to change it.

Please don't use this as reference for anything.
