#Hi! I'm a comment.</pre></div>
    <p>The program is divided into sections, with each section defining a certain thing about the program. Sections begin with a section header, a keyword specifying what section
       type this will be. Sections end with the <span class="code">end</span> keyword. Sections are typically indented but this is not required; whitespace is not significant.

    <h3>Features</h3>
    <h4>Technical Details</h4>
    <p>The datatype underlying all of the sound changer's actions is the feature. It is represented as a 64-bit bitmask (u64). Each feature is given an an area in that bitmask 
       to use. The area generation is automated but not 100% efficient. There are several rules it must follow when laying out features and the brute-force approach I
       implemented is not 100% efficient at laying things out.</p>
    <p>The chief difficulty in layout comes from the switch feature type. I implemented this because it felt strange having all features apply to all characters, after all the
       kinds of features in a vowel and in a consonant are very different. The switch type allows features to have a non-root parent, making features into a tree. Since it is
       bitmask based, that means that the features must be defined with no ambiguity by the bitmask, and that if the same feature has multiple parents, it lines up the same
       across all parents. Another issue is overlapping multi features, which requires more adjustment. The ineffiecencies aren't an issue; a fairly deatiled IPA implementation
       is well within a u64 and if it really became an issue I could move to u128.</p>
    <h4>Types of features</h4>
    <p>There are two main kinds of features, switch features and regular features. Switch features are similar to regular features except other features can apply only to certain
       features in a switch feature. In addition, features can be of a set of values, or they can be boolean. For example, manner of articulation would be of a set, whereas
       voicing would be boolean.</p>
    <h4>Defining Features</h4>
    <p>Features are defined in the <span class="code">feature_def</span> section. Each feature line has 3 parts - the <span class="code">feature</span> keyword, the feature
       definition itself, and the parent node. The parent node is used to make features apply only to certain switch type features. If you wish your feature to apply to
       everything, use either <span class="code">root</span> or <span class="code">all</span>. They are identical. The feature definition itself can take many forms. I will
       first show the boolean feature.</p>
    <div><pre>
feature_def
    feature +foo root
end</pre></div>
    <p>That code snippet creates a feature named +foo. Every letter will either not have the feature, called the absent value, and marked with -foo, or it will have the value
       present, marked with +foo. The absent value is the default.</p>
       <div><pre>
    feature foo(bar, baz, boo) root</pre></div>
    <p>That code snippet creates a feature named foo. It can have any of three values, bar, baz, or boo. The first value is selected as the default value.</p>
    <div><pre>
    switch foo(bar, baz, boo) root</pre></div>
    <p>To make a feature into a switch feature, just change the <span class="code">feature</span> keyword into the <span class="code">switch</span> keyword. This also creates a
       feature called foo with three values, bar, baz, or boo, but this feature can have other features parented to it. Otherwise it works exactly the same.</p>
    <div><pre>
feature_def
    switch foo(bar, baz, boo) root
    feature +ghost boo
end</pre></div>
    <p>In this code snippet, a boolean feature, +ghost, is created but only applies to the boo feature. Notice the second parameter, <span class="code">boo</span>. A bar 
       feature doesn't have that value, it cannot have that value. In this case our progam has 4 possible symbols: <span class="code">[bar]</span>,
       <span class="code">[baz]</span>, <span class="code">[boo -ghost]</span>, and <span class="code">[boo +ghost]</span>. (Brackets are used to represent feature matrices.)</p>
    <div><pre>
feature_def
    switch foo(bar, baz, boo) root
    feature +zombie foo!boo
end</pre></div>
    <p>In that code snippet, the +zombie feature applies to every subtype of foo <i>except</i> for boo.</p>
    <p>Putting it all together, below is a the full default implementation of the IPA features. It's also a good starting point anytime you are making a language.</p>
    <div><pre>
feature_def
    switch type(consonant, vowel) root

    feature +voice consonant
    switch manner(plosive, nasal, fricative, approximant, affricate, trill, tap) consonant
    switch place(bilabial, labiodental, dental, alveolar, postalveolar, retroflex, palatal, velar, uvular, pharyngeal, glottal) consonant
    feature +lateral (fricative, approximant)
    feature +ejective consonant
    feature +syllabic consonant

    feature +aspirated consonant!glottal
    feature +labialized consonant!bilabial
    feature +velarized consonant!velar
    feature +palatalized consonant!palatal
    feature +pharyngealized consonant!pharyngeal

    feature +nasal-release plosive

    feature +round vowel
    feature closeness(close, close-mid, mid-close, open-mid, open) vowel
    feature backness(front, mid-back, back) vowel
    feature +rhoticized vowel

    feature +long all
    feature +nasal all
    feature +breathy all

    feature +non-syllabic all
    feature +stress vowel
end</pre></div>
    <p>Notice how consonant properties (PoA, MoA) only apply to consonants, and same for vowels. Also notice that you can't velarize a velar consonant, etc.</p>
    <h3>Symbols</h3>
    <p>Symbols the translation layer between your program and human readable notation. Symbols are used in two slightly different ways in multiple places. Symbols strictly
       match when converting into sound change languages (i.e. word input or rule results) and less strictly match when using them for checking (predicates and enviorments).
       Symbols also strictly match when outputting into human readable format.</p>
    <p>Symbols are defined in the <span class="code">symbols</span> section. Each symbol line has 3 parts - the symbol keyword, the symbol itself, and the feature matrix. The
       symbol itself is the actual symbol that will get used in other parts of the code. The feature matrix
       defines the symbol. Symbols will always match with what you specify, but for things left as their defaults, they will only matter if the symbol is strictly matching.</p>
    <div><pre>
symbols
    symbol i [close front -round]
end</pre></div>
    <p>That creates the i symbol and assigns it to be close, front and unrounded. When strictly matching, it will also need to be -long, -nasal, -breathy, etc because those 
       are the defaults (assuming default IPA implementation). However, when not strictly matching, the length etc. does not matter.</p>
    <p>Sample symbol definitions for the IPA, designed to work with the above sample IPA feature definitions:</p>
    <div><pre>

end</pre></div>
    <h3>Diacritics</h3>
    <p>Diacritics encode a certain transformation, which can then be applied to a symbol to encode more information. This transformation is simpler than the full features of
       the sound change applier and does not have every feature.</p>
    <p>Diacritics are defined in the <span class="code">diacritics</span> section. Each diacritic line has 3 parts - the diacritic keyword, the diacritic itself, and the
       transformation</p>
    <div><pre>
    diacritic ː [-long] => [+long]</pre></div>
    <p>This defines a diacritic with the ː character (note this is the IPA long symbol, not a colon), and when this diacritic is applied to a symbol, it takes the symbol and
       transforms it according to the rule <span class="code">[-long] => [+long]</span>.
    <div><pre>
    diacritic ̥◌ [+voice] => [-voice]</pre></div>
    <p>This line contains two important features of the diacritic system. Firstly, the diacritics system is designed for unicode combining characters. That diacritics is actually
       two unicode codepoints, U+0325 (combining ring below) and U+25CC (dotted circle). The dotted circle is automatically removed because most combining characters that you can
       find online come on that dotted circle and it keeps the layout consistent. Secondly, diacritics are not just for encoding optional features, a diacritic can be applied
       to a symbol that changes a strict property of that symbol. Observe the following code snippet:</p>
    <div><pre>
feature_def
    ...
    feature +voice root
    switch manner(..., nasal, ...) consonant
    switch place(..., alveolar, ...) consonant
    ...
end

symbols
    ...
    symbol n [+voice alveolar nasal]
    ...
end

diacritics
    ...
    diacritic ̥◌ [+voice] => [-voice]
    ...
end</pre></div>
    <p>In the above incomplete code snippet of the full IPA implementation, the symbol n is strictly defined as voiced, however the shown diacritic can make it unvoiced. The
       n̥ symbol would thus represent <span class="code">[-voice alveolar nasal]</span>. Not all browsers display combining characters correctly.</p>
    <p>The full diacritics definition used by the default IPA implementation is below:</p>
    <div><pre>
diacritics
    diacritic ː [-long] => [+long]
    diacritic ̥◌ [+voice] => [-voice]
    diacritic ʰ [-aspirated] => [+aspirated]
    diacritic ʷ [-labialized] => [+labialized]
    diacritic ˠ [-velarized] => [+velarized]
    diacritic ʲ [-palatalized] => [+palatalized]
    diacritic ˤ [-pharyngealized] => [+pharyngealized]
    diacritic ⁿ [-nasal-release] => [+nasal-release]
    diacritic ' [-stress] => [+stress]
    diacritic ◌̯ [-non-syllabic] => [+non-syllabic]
end</pre></div>
    <h3>Basic Rules</h3>
    <p>Rules are the meat and potatoes of this program. They contain instructions which define the changes to sounds over time. Rules are defined in the 
       <span class="code">rules</span> section.</p>
    <h4>Basic syntax</h4>
    <p>A basic rule is defined as follows:</p>
    <div><pre class="q k">
...
rules
    rule uvular-plosive-to-velar
        q => k
    end
end</pre></div>
    <p>The above rule turns every q in the program into a k.</p>
    <div><pre class="q k χ x">
...
rules
    rule uvulars-to-velar
        q => k
        χ => x
    end
end</pre></div>
    <p>Rules can have multiple steps. Each step is executed in series.</p>
    <div><pre class="e i">
...
rules
    rule raise-vowel
        e => i
    end
end</pre></div>
    <p>With regards to symbols, symbols weakly match in the first part (called the predicate) and strictly match in the second part (called the result). That is any e, 
       regardless of length, nasality, etc. will match that e, but it will be turned into an i exactly. It is, however, worth noting that symbols match strictly when using a
       diacritic in the definition. Some inputs and outputs are below:</p>
    <div><pre>
e => i
eː => i</pre></div>
    <p>The * symbol can be used to delete a character. The following code deletes all glottals.</p>
    <div><pre>
...
rules
    rule glottal-loss
        [glottal] => *
    end
end</pre></div>
    <h4>Feature matrices</h4>
    <p>A key part of what makes this program more sophisticated than a simple find and replace is features. You can specify features for both inputs and outputs. Output feature
       matrices will modify only what is nessecary. For example, the uvular example from above can be rewritten as follows:</p>
    <div><pre>
...
rules
    rule uvulars-to-velar
        [uvular] => [velar]
    end
end</pre></div>
    <p>The above code will turn everything which matches the uvular feature into a velar, while preserving all other properties.</p>
    <div><pre>
    rule lengthen-back
        [back] => [+long]
    end</pre></div>
    <p>The features effected don't have to be the same either. The above code makes every back vowel long.</p>
    <p>You can also invert features, for example <span class="code">[!back]</span> is a valid feature matrix. Be careful, that matches everything that isn't back, including all
       consonants. Instead, you should probably use <span class="code">[vowel !back]</span>.</p>
    <h4>Multiple transformations</h4>
    <p>There are various ways to make the same rule do multiple things. Using curly brackets <span class="code">{}</span> gives multiple sets of inputs and outputs. For example
       a complex lenition rule could be written as follows:</p>
    <div><pre class="p b t d k g β ð ɣ">
    rule lenition
        {p b t d k g} => {b β d ð g ɣ}
    end</pre></div>
    <p>The above rule turns p into b, b into β, etc.</p>
    <p>If you wish to modify two or more letters at once, there is also an option for that.</p>
    <div><pre class="z v s r">
    rule zv-change
        z v => s r
    end</pre></div>
    <p>This changes all zv clusters into sr clusters.</p>
    <p>This can be combined with the sets of inputs and outputs.</p>
    <div><pre class="k g i c ɟ e">
    rule palatalization
        {k g} i => {c ɟ} e
    end</pre></div>
    <p>The above rule implements rudimentry palatalization, turning every ki and gi cluster into ce and ɟe clusters.</p>
    <p>Of course it's probably more sensible to implement palatalization with features, like so:</p>
    <div><pre class="i e">
    rule palatalization
        [velar] i => [palatal] e
    end</pre></div>
    <h3>Enviorment rules</h3>
    <p>All the rules are depedent entirely on the content of the rules to execute. You could make them depend on their enviorment by doing a multiple predicate and not modifying
       the output, but there is a simpler solution: enviorments. The enviorment comes after the result and is signified with a <span class="code">/</span>.</p>
    <h4>Basic enviorments</h4>
    <p>The enviorment system matches the enviorment around the letter. The position of the letter is marked with a <span class="code">_</span>.</p>
    <div><pre class="i">
    rule palatalization
        [velar] => [palatal] / _ i
    end</pre></div>
    <p>The above code is the palatalization from before, except the i doesn't change to an e.</p>
    <p>Of course enviorments can also use features. The following code rounds all vowels after uvulars:</p>
    <div><pre>
    rule uvulars-round
        [vowel] => [+round] / [uvular] _
    end</pre></div>
    <p>Notice how the underscore has moved to after the condition.</p>
    <p>Finally, enviorments can be inverted with a <span class="code">//</span>. The following code deletes h except before plosives:</p>
    <div><pre class="h">
    rule delete-h-except-plosives
        h => * // _ [plosive]
    end</pre></div>
    <h4>Word boundaries</h4>
    <p>Rules often care about word boundaries, for example French loses most word final consonants. A <span class="code">$</span> symbol indicates a word boundary in
       enviorments.</p>
    <div><pre>
    rule word-final-consonant-loss
        [consonant] => * / _ $
    end</pre></div>
    <p>The above code unconditionally removes word final consonants.</p>
    <h4>Variable quantaties</h4>
    <p>In enviorments, variable quantities of matches can be set. A <span class="code">?</span> after the condition matches either 0 or 1. Likewise, a
       <span class="code">*</span> matches any number, including 0, whereas a <span class="code">+</span> requires at least one.</p>
    <div><pre>
    rule stress-ultimate
        [vowel] => [+stress] / _ [consonant]* $
    end</pre></div>
    <p>The above rule stressed the final syllable.</p>
    <h4>Letter insertion</h4>
    <p>Similar to how you can specify none in the result, you can specify none in the input. Previous, this wasn't too useful becasue it would insert characters everywhere, but
       with enviorments, we can specify the insertion point to make it useful.</p>
    <div><pre class="e">
    rule breakup-plosive-clusters
        * => e / [plosive] _ [plosive]
    end</pre></div>
    <p>The above code breaks up all plosive clusters with an e.</p>
    <h3>Captures in Rules</h3>
    <p>A capture allows an part of a predicate to affect a result. For example, a rule could capture character of a predicate, and set another character to it, creating
       assimilation. Captures can be used to detect geminates, perform metathesis, or create assimilation rules.</p>
    <h4>Basic captures</h4>
    <p>Captures are performed with the <span class="code">$</span> operator, followed by a number. The number is the capture ID. Captures are captured in the predicate and used
       in the result. Captures are placed after the symbol or feature matrix. Right now, they cannot stand on their own so if you wish to have a bare capture, just use a empty
       feature matrix, like so: <span class="code">[]$1</span>. I believe an example would illuminate things.</p>
    <div><pre class="h">
    rule h-change
        h []$1 => []$1 []
    end</pre></div>
    <p>The above rule turns every h into a copy of what follows it. When checking the predicate, it saves the value into the capture, which can then be referenced in the result.</p>
    <p>If in the prediacte the program finds a capture it's already assigned to, then it checks if the capture matches the predicate. If not, it fails the test. That way you can
       test for gemination or reduplication.</p>
    <div><pre>
    rule degemination
        []$1 []$1 => []$1 *
    end</pre></div>
    <p>The above rule unconditionally degeminates everything.</p>
    <h4>Feature captures</h4>
    <p>Captures are not limited to capturing all the features of a letter. You can specify a capture to capture a set of features. Only specify features on the first instance
       of the capture in the predicate, if applicable.

    <div><pre>
    rule nasal-assimilation
        [nasal] [consonant !nasal]$1(place) => []$1 []
    end</pre></div>
    <p>The above rule applies nasal assimilation, that is it takes a nasal before another consonant and matches it's place of articulation to consonant. Notice in english 
       in + possible = i<b>m</b>possible.</p>
    <h4>Examples using captures</h4>
    <p>Geminate consonants with a following h:</p>
    <div><pre class="h">
    rule h-triggered-gemination
        []$1 h => [] []$1
    end</pre></div>
    <p>Degeminates all consonants:</p>
    <div><pre>
    #The consonant in the predicate is unnessecary 
    #because it has to match to begin with
    rule degemination
        [consonant]$1 []$1 => []$1 * #
    end</pre></div>
    <p>Degeminates plosives:</p>
    <div><pre>
    rule degemination
        [plosive]$1 []$1 => []$1 *
    end</pre></div>
    <p>Nasal assimilation:</p>
    <div><pre>
    rule nasal-assimilation
        [nasal] [consonant !nasal]$1(place) => []$1 []

    <h2>Complex language topics</h2>
    <p>These topics are more complex and generally not required for writing most sound changes. They may be useful if you try to use this for something unusual.</p>
    <h3>Control flow</h3>
    <p>By default rules are executed top to bottom, however you can change that. This is not typically very useful but does make it turing complete (probably) so it's a neat 
       feature. This may also be useful for writing actual sound changs. It's mostly just for fun though.</p>
    <h4>Jumps</h4>
    <p>The most fundemental part of control flow is the jump. Jumps can be conditional or unconditional. Unconditional jumps are not typically useful without being paired with
       conditional jumps. Both kinds of jumps are marked with the <span class="code">jmp</span> keyword, following by the label. Labels are where the program jumps to and are 
       defined by the <span class="code">label</span> keyword. An example may be helpful:</p>
    <div><pre class="e i o u">
rules
    rule e-to-i#this executes normally
        e => i
    end

    jmp skip

    rule o-to-u #this gets skipped
        o => u
    end

    label skip
end</pre></div>
    <p>A conditional jump is marked by putting the name of the flag you wish to control the jump with after the label name. If you wish to invert this condition use the 
        <span class="code">!</span> symbol before it, i.e. <span class="code">jmp foo !flag</span>. The flags are described in the following section.</p>
    <h4>Flags</h4>
    <p>Lexica currently has two kinds of flag; the the modify <span class="code">mod</span> flag and <span class="code">flag</span> flag (I am open to better names for that). The 
       modify flag is set if the word is modified; the following code removes every uvular, and if the word contained a uvular, making the first consonant a uvular.</p>
    <div><pre>
rules
    rule remove-uvular
        [uvular] => [velar]
    end

    jmp skip !mod

    rule make-first-uvular
        [consonant] => [uvular] / $ _
    end

    label skip
end</pre></div>
    <p>In the above code snippet, the jump skips the relevant rule if the word was not modified by the previous rule.</p>
    <p>The flag flag is set by the detect keyword. It allows you to create custom conditions for your jumps. The detect keyword takes a predicate and enviorment exactly as you
       would expect when writing a regular rule. Keep in mind, in a regular rule it's <span class="code">{predicate} => {result} / {enviorment}</span> (or 
       <span class="code">//</span>); in a detect it's <span class="code">{predicate} / {enviorment}</span>, likewise with the slashes. For example, the following code changes s
       to ʃ if and only if there is an h anywhere in the string (not exactly naturalistic but let's not go there).</p>
    <div><pre class="h s ʃ">
rules
    detect h

    jmp skip flag
    
    rule s-change
        s => ʃ
    end

    label skip
end</pre></div>
